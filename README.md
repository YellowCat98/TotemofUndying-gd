# Totem of Undying

A mod that lets people activate the totem of undying by hitting the C key.
This mod has its own "Totems" stat, this stat holds how many totems you can activate.
This stat increases whenever your star count increases, for example, beating a 10 star level, this grants you 10 totems, and so on.
