# Totem of Undying

- A mod that lets people activate the totem of undying from minecraft by hitting the C key. (can be changed in Custom Keybinds settings)

- After activating the Totem of undying, you get a 1.65 second invincibility/noclip effect.

- This mod has its own "Totems" stat, this stat holds how many totems you can activate.

- This stat increases whenever your star count increases, for example, beating a 10 star level, this grants you 10 totems, and so on.

### If it isn't obvious, this mod is made for fun, and is meant to be used for fun. I don't condone cheating in any way.
